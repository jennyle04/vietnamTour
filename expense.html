<p>
    Since the monthly salary in Vietnam is significantly less than an American's average monthly salary, <br>
    this makes Vietnam one of the best places to visit to enjoy an extravagant lifestyle that some could only <br>
    experience once in their lifetime. Vietnam is a very inexpensive country, especially if you are an American <br>
    and you bring USD to convert to Vietnamese currency.
