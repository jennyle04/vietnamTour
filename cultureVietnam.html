    Lanterns are used in many Vietnamese festivals. The Vietnamese would light up lanterns and have them float up in the sky. Some people believe in the theory <br> 
    that if they light up a lantern in the sky with their respected partner, then they would boost their chances of having everlasting love.<br>

<h2>Social Beliefs</h2>

<p style="text-align:left">
    In Vietnam, citizens are taught that the importance of family is greater than the worth of self. <br>
    Hence, it is common to see the generation of great-grandma to the current generation living in one house. <br>
    This is called 'filial piety', which means showing respect and care for parents and ancestors.<br>
    This belief does not only stay amongst family, but encouraged for all community. <br>
    This means, the people in Vietnam will always demonstrate selflessness for those in need. <br>
    To suffer together- to grow together. The belief of this helps tourists to feel a homely <br>
    environment.
