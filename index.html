<p>
    Vietnam's flag is a yellow five-pointed star on a crimson backdrop. <br>
    The flag is a symbol of the country's resistance against French and communist dominance. <br>
    Despite its stormy history, the star on the flag reflects the country's national unity.
</p>

<p>
    After the Vietnam War, with time, Vietnam has became a <br>
    bustling, flourishing, and prospering country in Southeast Asia. <br>
    It is home to approximately 98 million Vietnamese people as of year 2022. <br>
    The lifestyle of a typical Vietnamese person may perplex numerous foreigners. <br>
    It is uncommon for a Vietnamese to be inside in private. Due to the abundance <br>
    amount of street food and curbside attractions, the Vietnamese are always out <br>
    on the sidewalk. There are curbside barbershops, which means you can get a haircut <br>
    out in the open by going down the street. You're hungry and you don't want to drive? <br>
    Just walk outside! Chances are, there is a street food seller outside of your home.
