<h2>Mausoleum of Emperor Khai Dinh</h2>
<p>
    The Mausoleum of Emperor Khai Dinh is the tomb of the <br>
    12th Emperor of the Nguyễn dynasty. It finished building <br>
    in 1931 and it took 11 years to construct. This is a very <br>
    magnificent location that marked a major point for Vietnam. <br>
    It was the final tomb that a Vietnamese Emperor could build <br>
    for himself because the 13th Emperor had been abdicated, <br>
    which lead to ending the dynasty.
